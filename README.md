# -Premier-League-Oracle-Video-Analysis-with-Deep-Learning
As Intern at oracle and interest in machine learning and football I took the opportunity to do the premier league oracle video analysis deep learning lab, using the oracle cloud
I used autonomous data warehouse to store the database or the video, e.g. what each is in each frame, e.g player, nets as well as Vision in analystics which takes an image and checks what is it in using ML, and Data science Notebook where the python code was used to develop our model. I Will share the python code as well as the videos this code created which shows analysis, including shirt number, lines on pitch, including penalty box and the nets.

Files which are too big will be linked in google drive, check code folder to see
